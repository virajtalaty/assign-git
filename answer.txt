Why should you have different branches?
- We should have differnt branches because it helps in Version Control and working on different versions of the application.
- As in one team can work on defects in the application on a particular branch while other team can work on new functionality in a differnt branch and finally merge as and when necessary.
- If we have only one branch and there are some issues in that branch then we need to go thorught the commits and probably revert to a working state manually.
- With differnt branches we can have different versions of the tool, so if we need to revert to previous state we can do that also.
